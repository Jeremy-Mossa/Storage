# To compress:
tar -zcvf archive_name.tar.gz directory_to_compress

# To decompress an archive use the following syntax:
tar -zxvf archive_name.tar.gz

# loop through tar.gz files and extract to dirs with their names
for i in $(ls); do tar --one-top-level=$i -xzvf $i; done

Lastly, the extensions .tgz and .tar.gz are equivalent; they both signify
a tar file zipped with gzip.
