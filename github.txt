# Install git, then navigate to the development directory. Initialize git:

git init

# Add a remote, which is like a remote control from local machine to github
# And make it for ssh, after setting up ssh and copying rsa.pub key to github
# The name of the remote in this case is ssh

git remote add ssh ssh://git@github.com/<username>/<repository_name> 

# To update github repository (master branch) to match local machine:

git push ssh master

# An example of .git/config such that `git push` simply works
