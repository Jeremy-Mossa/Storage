split -b 1M <archive-name>.tar.gz "parts-prefix"

-b 1M will split the file into 1 Megabytes size of file.The
"part-prefix" will give the prefix name of our parts of
file.

Example:

We have a video file name video.avi that have size of 30 MB.
We will split it into 5 MB per parts. We can do :

$ tar -cvvzf test.tar.gz  video.avi

$ split -v 5M test.tar.gz vid

This command will create the archive file name test.tar.gz.
Then, it will split into (approximately) six parts of 5MB
file. They have prefix "vid", so the result will be vidaa,
vidab, vidac, vidad, vidae, and vidaf. We can use number
instead of letter on the suffix by adding -d option on the
split command

$ split -v 5M -d test.tar.gz video.avi

 to join this file, we can use cat command.

$ cat vid* > test.tar.gz
